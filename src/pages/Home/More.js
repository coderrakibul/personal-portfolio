                    The creation of this portfolio provided me with a chance to reflect on both my technical skills and my professional skills for several years. As you browse around, I hope that you are able to gain a strong sense of me. Each section of this portfolio represents a small piece of information that reflects who I am and what I am capable of.</h5>
